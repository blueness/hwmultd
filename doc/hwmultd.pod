=head1 NAME

B<hwmultd> - multicast hardware information, or respond to mutlicasted hardware
information

=head1 SYNOPSIS

hwmultd [-h] [-v] [-c F<config> ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<hwmultd> operates in one of two modes (or both).  As a server, B<hwmultd>
monitors hardware information and multicasts it so that other computers in
the same multicast group can act accordingly.  As a client, B<hwmultd>
listens to multicasted hardware information and acts accordingly.  For
example, one box (the server) can multicast entropy while others listening
(the clients) can add it to their own entropy pools.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<no option>

	This is the normal mode of operation.  hmultd reads its configuration
	file and forks into the background as a daemon

B<-c config>

	Use an alternate configuration file instead of
	/etc/hwmultd/hwmultd.conf, but otherwise operate as if no option
	were given.

	Print out information about command line options and exit.

B<-v>

	Print out version information and exit.
