Hardware Multicast Daemon

hwmond is a daemon to multicast hardware information.  It should be
useful for mutlicasting temperature, entropy, load, etc, so that other
servers on the same subnet can act on that information.

This is a daemon which reads temperatures from a "Tempature Alert" usb probe
and then multicasts the temperature to other computer on the LAN.  These
can then decide to shutdown if the temperature gets above some acceptible
limit.
