Before we release for the first time:

[skipping - not that important] 1. Change the Message option in libexample_{cl,hw}.conf to variadic

2. Make server optionally a pure server (as it is now) or server+client

3. Set aside another signal to reset hardware - probably SIGUSR1

4. Plugin work:

	a. Add a standardized error return code from the plugins
	[DONE] b. Switch from shared library naming to module naming
	c. Create typedef to properly include hwplugin.h and clplugin.h into plugin.h
	d. Have configure check for dlopen and use conditional #ifdef in the code
